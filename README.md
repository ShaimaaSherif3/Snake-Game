# Snake Game

## Game Description

This is a traditional snake game written using Python and the curses library. The goal of the game is to collect food to increase the size of the snake while avoiding hitting walls or the snake's body itself.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake:
- *UP*: Upward movement.
- *DOWN*: Downward movement.
- *LEFT*: Leftward movement.
- *RIGHT*: Rightward movement.
- The goal is to collect food (which appears as a diamond symbol) to increase the length of the snake and increase points.
- Avoid hitting walls or the snake's body as this will end the game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- curses library (comes with Python on Unix systems such as Linux and macOS).
